# R Packages and Functions for Labs

Here is some R packages and Functions I created to make my labs easier at university. 

<h2> Objective </h2>
I made R packages and functions to make labs easier at school, so specific equations would be solved immediately, these packages will be physics and chemistry equations. R will also help me organize data easier when needed.

<h2> R Packages and Functions per Lab </h2>
<h3> Gas Chemistry R Functions </h3>
These conseceutive functions are simple functions, so I can insert my repetitive data quicker into equations. Since the lab report requires no graphing I only created mathematical functions for this lab.
